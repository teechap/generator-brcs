### What is this?
This is a starter template for a React application written with CoffeeScript, Browserify, and Stylus. It also comes with a live-reloading dev server so everything is compiled and updated in the browser when you save changes to your code. FYI, this will eventually be a Yeoman generator but it's not finished yet.

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `gulp` to build the application and serve it locally.
4. Visit `localhost:8000` in your browser to verify the app is running.
5. Make a change to the starter app and save it. The change should automatically show up in your browser.
